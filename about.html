    <h1>About $POUCH</h1>
    <p>He didn’t fall from a tree—he was yeeted from the blockchain during a liquidity rug at 3am.<br>
    Birthed in a gas war, fermented in a wallet with no seed phrase, and raised by airdropped trash tokens, this apple wasn’t grown—he was summoned. One part fruit, two parts fury, and 100% unregulated.<br><br>
    They said he’d never make it. Said apples couldn’t pump. Said juice doesn’t belong on chain.<br>
    But he didn’t listen. He was too busy squeezing.<br><br>
    His pouch isn’t just a snack—it’s a weapon. Packed with raw chart energy, enough natural pump to scare a stablecoin. Every squeeze sends shockwaves through the timeline. Candles? Green. Charts? Moist. Traders? Horny.<br><br>
    He doesn’t count macros. He counts wallets. He doesn’t offer financial advice. He offers pressure.<br><br>
    Now he roams the BASE chain shirtless, vein-popping, coin-flipping, and absolutely cooked off his own supply.<br><br>
    If you’re reading this, it’s already too late. You’re deep in the orchard now.<br><br>
    <strong>Welcome to $POUCH.<br>Every squeeze leaves a stain.</strong>
